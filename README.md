# Microservices

## Gateway Service

Responsibilities

- Single entry point
- JWT validation
- Request routing
- HTTPS termination
- CORS configuration

Routes

```
api/auth/**
api/products/**
api/media/**
api/uploads/**
```

---

## User Service

Responsibilities

- Registration
- Login
- JWT generation
- User Profile
- Kafka Producer

Database

MongoDB

redis

---

## Product Service

Responsibilities

- CRUD Products
- Product Search
- Product Images
- Kafka Consumer

Database

MongoDB

---

## Media Service

Responsibilities

- Upload Images
- Store Files
- Serve Uploaded Files

---

# Authentication

JWT is generated after successful login.

The Angular application stores the JWT and attaches it to every authenticated request.

Gateway validates every incoming token before forwarding requests to internal services.

---

# Kafka Communication

Current Event

```
UserDeletedEvent
```

Flow

```
User Service
      |
      | Publish Event
      |
    Kafka
      |
      | Consume Event
      |
Product Service
```

This allows services to communicate asynchronously without direct dependencies.

---
# Cache 
- redis
---
# Security

- JWT Authentication
- HTTPS
- Spring Security
- Gateway Authorization
- CORS Protection

---

# Image Upload Flow

```
Angular

    |
nginx
    |
POST api/media/upload

    |

Gateway

    |

Media Service

    |

uploads/

    |

Image URL

    |

Angular displays image
```
